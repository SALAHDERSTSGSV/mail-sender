    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

    <p>At Coolaimy, we are committed to delivering high-quality digital services. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we want to ensure you are confident when purchasing from us. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which you may request a refund.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility for Refund</h2>
    <p>You may request a refund if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The request is made within 7 days of your original payment date.</li>
      <li>You have not fully consumed or used the core features of the product (such as API access, credits, or premium tools).</li>
      <li>You provide a valid reason explaining why the service did not meet your expectations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Requests made after 7 days of the purchase date.</li>
      <li>When significant usage or downloads have been made on your account.</li>
      <li>If the refund reason is based solely on change of mind, or lack of understanding of how the tool works (without contacting support).</li>
      <li>Repeated refund requests from the same customer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>To initiate a refund, please email our support team at <a href="mailto:admin@coolaimy.online">admin@coolaimy.online</a> and include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your full name and email used for purchase</li>
      <li>Your order or transaction ID</li>
      <li>A brief explanation of your reason for the refund request</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All refund requests are reviewed within 2 business days. If your request is approved, the refund will be processed to your original payment method within 5–10 business days depending on your bank or provider.</p>

    <h2>4. Subscription Refunds</h2>
    <p>If your purchase is a subscription, you may cancel it at any time. Refunds for subscription renewals are only granted if the request is made within 48 hours of the renewal charge and if no major usage has occurred during that period.</p>

    <h2>5. Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>Initiating a chargeback through your payment provider without contacting us first may result in the suspension of your account and further action if necessary. We encourage all customers to speak with us first — we are here to help.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This refund policy may be updated occasionally to reflect improvements or legal changes. We encourage users to review this page periodically. Continued use of our service implies agreement to the latest version of the refund policy.</p>
